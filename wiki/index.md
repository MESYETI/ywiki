# Welcome to my website/wiki
### About me
I'm an 18 year old hobbyist programmer that is interested in low level programming. I
mainly write projects in D and C. My main project for a while has been [Callisto](/callisto.html),
which I have been working on since March 2024.

I made this wiki because I want to document all the things I find that are interesting
(unless they already have their own good documentation - then I won't). I also want to
make pages for the projects I am making and whatever else I'm doing. Maybe I'll even
develop new skills to write about here.

Visit the page list on the top bar to see what I have written, or look at the
[secret manul page](/secret-manul-page.html).

For Gemini and Gopher fans, I plan on eventually putting my wiki on those protocols.
