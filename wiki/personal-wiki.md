# Personal wiki
A personal wiki is a wiki made by and worked on by one person. The website you are on
right now is a personal wiki. They are pretty easy to make and I recommend making one
if you enjoy learning.

## List of personal wikis
- [Devine Lu Linvega's wiki](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/)
- [Melvian's wiki](https://wiki.melvian.net/)
